QuizSync is designed as a real-time classroom quiz system that can comfortably support 20–50 participants per room under normal classroom or college network conditions, with all users connected simultaneously. Since the application uses Firebase Firestore’s real-time listeners, updates such as turn changes, questions, answers, and scores are synchronized instantly across all connected devices. The system does not impose a fixed limit on the number of questions; instead, questions continue to be asked turn by turn until the game completes one full cycle, meaning the participant who started the quiz eventually answers a question. In practice, the total number of questions equals the number of participants minus one, ensuring fairness and equal participation. The architecture is serverless and scalable, so performance mainly depends on network stability and Firebase limits rather than local hardware, making it suitable for typical classroom, lab, or small seminar use.
