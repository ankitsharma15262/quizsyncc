QuizSync is a real-time, turn-based quiz platform built for classroom and group activities. Participants join using a room code and are automatically assigned to two groups (A and B) in alternating order. The game follows a structured flow where one group asks a question, the opposite group answers, and the asking group awards marks (0, 0.5, or 1). Turns rotate fairly between all participants, scores update instantly for everyone, and the game ends automatically when the user who started the quiz finally answers a question, completing the full cycle.
